              You've claimed more KLIMA than your supply-share limit. This is

              The updated contract now assumes pKLIMA holders have staked and
              earned rewards on previously claimed tokens. Prior to the November
              fix, these staking rewards were not counted against your supply
              share limit, which meant your share of the total KLIMA supply
              could surpass the limit defined in your terms.

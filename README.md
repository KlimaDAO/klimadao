# Summary

This repo contains 6 packages.

`@klimadao/app` -> app.klimadao.finance, a standalone single-page-app for protocol interactions.

`@klimadao/carbon-projects` -> A Sanity CMS that contains curated data for Verra projects, deployed to [carbon-projects.sanity.studio](https://carbon-projects.sanity.studio/), and referenced by the Carbonmark frontend and backend. NOTE: Unlike the other packages, this one is **not** included as an NPM workspace from the root package.json. To work with the CMS you need to run `sanity install` from inside the `carbon-projects` folder.

`@klimadao/carbon` -> data.klimadao.finance site (formerly carbon.klimadao.finance)

`@klimadao/lib` -> Components and utilities that are shared between packages.

`@klimadao/site` -> klimadao.finance homepage, content and cms-powered pages.

## Development

A set of NPM Workspace commands are provided, and can be run from the root folder.

- `npm run dev-all`: run all workspaces with hot reloading enabled.
- `npm run dev-app`: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- `npm run dev-carbonmark`: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
- `npm run dev-carbonmark-api`: [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)
- `npm run dev-site`: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run dev-lib`: enable hot-reload for changes to components or utils.

Other scripts you should know about:

- `npm run build-all`: build all workspaces.
- `npm run format-all`: Format all files with `prettier`.
- `npm run extract-strings:dev`: Extract translation files for the source language "en".

## Type Generation
Typescript types for Carbonmark and Carbonmark API are generated via the `generate:types` script in each respective project. 

Regenerate types in any of the following changes:

1. Models in the API  (.model files)
2. Change to any of the dependant subgraphs (see `codegen.constants.ts`)
3. API Version targeted by Carbonmark

## Translations

### For Developers

This repo uses [lingui](https://lingui.js.org/tutorials/react.html) in combination with [translation.io](https://translation.io).

We follow these rules:

- Don't use ids, except for very long strings.
- Extract the source translation with `npm run extract-strings:dev`
- Commit source language files "en" only

### For translators

#### Setup

- Create an account on [translation.io](https://translation.io)
- Request access to the project atmosfearful/klimadao in the #content-translation KlimaDAO discord server

#### Translating

- Log in [translation.io](https://translation.io)
- Select the appropriate project klimadao-site or klimadao-app
- Make sure you select the appropriate language in the top menu

- Select an item to translate in the left column
- On the bottom right you will notice the source text (in English) and the place to translate the text beneath.

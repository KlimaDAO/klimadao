          <Trans>
            Loss of Investment: The value of $KLIMA and other cryptocurrencies
            can rapidly increase or decrease at any time. As a result, you could
            experience significant and rapid losses, including the loss of all
            money invested.

            Lack of Liquidity: There may be no active market for $KLIMA, which
            may result in losses if you need to sell your tokens quickly.

            Regulatory Actions and Changes: The regulatory environment for
            cryptocurrencies is evolving and changes in regulation could

            Operational Risks: The KlimaDAO platform relies on various
            technologies related to the Polygon network and other digital
            assets. These technologies are subject to change, and such changes
            could adversely affect your investment.

            the $KLIMA token will achieve its objectives or that any value will
            be retained in the Protocol.

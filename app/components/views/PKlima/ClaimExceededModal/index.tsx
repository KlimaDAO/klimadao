                The updated contract now assumes pKLIMA holders have staked and
                earned interest on previously claimed tokens. Prior to the
                November fix, these staking rewards were not counted against your
                supply share limit, which meant your share of the total KLIMA
                supply could surpass the limit defined in your terms.

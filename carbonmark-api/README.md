<br />

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to be authenticated to the following in order to run the project:

- Vercel - https://vercel.com/klimadao/carbonmark-api

- Firebase - https://console.firebase.google.com/project/klimadao-staging

\*\*Note all `vercel` commands should be run from within the root klimadao (monorepo) directory.

\*\*All others should be run from within the `carbonmark-api` folder

### Link your local copy of the project with vercel

1. You must be a member of the KlimaDAO project in Vercel.
2. Say `Y`es when prompted to link the project to an existing project.
3. Existing project name is `carbonmark-api`.

- run from root

```sh
vercel  link
```

### Environment Variables

The vercel config is where all environment variables required for the project are defined and can be pulled down via the `vercel-cli`.

Using the below command, the newest version of vercel cli will create a `.vercel`folder in the root and install the env variables in `.vercel/.env.development.local`.

Previous versions created and stored in an `.env.local` in the root.

Ensure you have updated vercel cli to the latest version (31.0.4 as of this doc)

### **Note:** You will need to manually remove the beginning and trailing quotation marks on the `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CERT` env var in `.vercel/env.development.local` otherwise you will receive a _SyntaxError: Unexpected token_ error when trying to run the project

- run from root

```sh
vercel env pull --environment development .env.local
```

or

```sh
vercel env pull --environment production .env.local
```

### Install dependencies

- run from root

```sh
cd  carbonmark-api && npm  ci
```

## Coming from previous version

In `carbonmark-api/`:

Delete the current `dist` folder if it exists

Run `npm run build` to create a new `dist` folder with the correct path

Anyone can buy KLIMA at a discount by bonding carbon units and LP shares over a set vesting period.","tour.bonding.title":"Bonding","tour.carbon.text":"KLIMA is a vacuum for carbon. The treasury only accepts certified, third-party verified emissions reductions from reputable carbon markets (sometimes called 'carbon offsets' or 'carbon credits'). Each is tokenized in a transparent and traceable way to prevent double-spending or double-offsetting. These credits are sucked off the market and absorbed into the system through a Bonding mechanism.","tour.carbon.title":"Carbon Credits","tour.staking.text":"Carbon comes in, value comes out. Holders of KLIMA can earn compounding interest on their KLIMA by staking. Staking encourages long-term holding of KLIMA, and allows participants to benefit from the rising price of carbon. As the protocol generates a profit through Bond sales, this profit is allocated to everyone who has staked KLIMA.","tour.staking.title":"Klima Treasury","tour.treasury.text":"The treasury is the center of the black hole. Every KLIMA token is backed by 1 tonne of verified, tokenized carbon reduction or removal.
